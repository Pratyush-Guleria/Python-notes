Comments are non-executable lines in a program that are used to explain the code. The Python interpreter ignores them during execution.



## What problem does it solves ?
    • Helps to understand the code properly
    • Helps to explain the logic
    • Helps to explain your code
> ⚠️ Important :- In Python, single-line comments are written using the # symbol.

## Types of comments 
    • Single line comments
    • Multi line comments 


## Example :-
## Single line comments

name = input("Enter your name :")  # Here we asked user's name
print(name)                        # Here we just printed the user's name

## Example :-
## Multi line comments

'''
Here we asked user's name and printed it
'''
name = input("Enter your name :")
print(name)
> ⚠️ Important :- In Python, triple quotes (''' or """) are often used as multi-line comments, but technically they are multi-line string literals.
