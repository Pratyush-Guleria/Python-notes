# f-Strings

## What is an f-string?

An f-string (formatted string literal) is a modern and readable way to insert variables inside strings.

It makes code:
- Cleaner
- More readable
- More efficient

## Example

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}")

Here:
- f before the string allows variable interpolation
- {name} inserts the variable into the string
