## What is Indentation?

Indentation means adding spaces before code blocks.

In Python:
- Indentation defines structure
- It is mandatory
- Default is 4 spaces

Example:

age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")

If indentation is incorrect:
Python will throw an error.

Unlike other languages,
Python uses indentation instead of curly braces {}.
